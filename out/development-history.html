Location tech was driven by bluebotics, UI Layout was built with Angular, and D3.js.</div></div><div class="terminal-card"><header>Tik Tok Bookmarking Web App (Angular.js, Node.js)(Vue.js, Node.js)</header><div><p>Created bookmarking application called <em><a href="https://clockipedia.com">Clockipedia</a></em> for bookmarking, tagging, and organizing TikToks into playlists.</p><p>The entire site is being rebuilt in Nuxt.js / Vue.js.  I want to make the tags I assign to the bookmarks publicly searchable, so that other people can find or recommend tags for specific TikToks.</p></div></div><div class="terminal-card"><header>Dynamic SignalR API Subscription Endpoint Handling (Angular)</header><div>Created Angular class which serves as a data-provider to any given angular component, which manages its own subscription state as a signalR client, to the server hub. Would also do inbound data comparisons before triggering updates in Zone.js to prevent exaggerated render as server would publish data on interval, rather than on relevant data / state change.</div></div><div class="terminal-card"><header>SignalR Hub Endpoint / API Updates (C#)</header><div>Based on needs from the Front-End of the application, API endpoints would be updated to return differently queried data, an updated DTO, or perhaps even the event handler and response names needed updating.</div></div><div class="terminal-card"><header>Azure Functions Serverless Microservice Setup (Node.js)</header><div>These are incredibly useful and I have used them for a large number of use cases, but the best production instance was for as a telemetry receiver.  The function would be invoked by an observer PC, that collected process data from manufacturing machines. This data would be validated in the server function, then loaded into either an Azure blob, SQL table, or MongoDB Doc depending on the use-case by interfacing with respective DB API.</div></div><div class="terminal-card"><header>OPC UA Client &amp; Server (Python &amp; Node.js)</header><div>Created a custom OPC client and server for establishing communications to Siemens S7-1500 controller. The server had the additional responsibility of broadcasting collected data via HTTP to an azure serverless function so that it could be logged for machine OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) analysis.</div></div><div class="terminal-card"><header>Shuttle Pallet Delivery System (SCL | Pascal)</header><div>Reverse engineered a shuttle delivery system for Wal-mart Refrigerated Storage division, to receive pallets containing various food products, and shuttle these pallets to the appropriate drop zones so they could be further allocated into 3D storage racks.</div></div><div class="terminal-card"><header>Battery Cell Casing Cleaning, Inspection, and Packing (SCL | PASCAL)</header><div>Developed various software solutions at Tesla Gigafactory Reno, for the handling of battery cell casings. Primarily focused on a machine called a palletizer which would receive trays of casings, and neatly stack the trays on a pallet in preparation to be moved to the next part of the facility so they could be used to house battery chemicals and components.</div></div><div class="terminal-card"><header>Data Collection and Display System (Vue.js, Node.js, Azure)</header><div>Used Node.js, Azure Functions, and Vue.js to create a data collection and display system that showed production floor managers, and the manufacturing engineering team relevant performance metrics, error states, and realtime production status for connected devices and machines.</div></div><div class="terminal-card"><header>Bulb Integrity Testing System (Ladder Logic [Allen Bradley])</header><div><p>Reprogrammed a Bulb Integrity evaluation system using Cognex Vision system.  This system would heat a bulb to a specific temperature, observe changes in the bulb, allow the bulb to cool, then observe again.</p><p>Based on the changes in the bulb it would be passed or failed to be installed into a Fire Sprinkler.</p></div></div></div></section></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/development-history","query":{},"buildId":"irIND-PGjwhapUiH9fvkS","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
